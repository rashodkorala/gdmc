# GDPC's most powerful feature is probably its transformation system. It is however also one of its
# more complex features.

# The transformation system allows you to "transform" your frame of reference for placing blocks,
# so that you can always build using local coordinates instead of global ones. The idea is based on
# the use of transformation matrices in 3D graphics engines.

# If you're programming, say, a house function, you could just always build the house at (0,0,0)
# with its door pointing north, and then later call the function with different transformations to
# place the house at any position and under any rotation.


# ==================================================================================================
# The Transform class
# ==================================================================================================

# At the core of the transformation system lies the Transform class, which acts more or less like a
# transformation matrix. It represents a transformation of space, or more simply, an operation to
# apply to vectors. Transforms consist of three components:
# - A *translation* vector (a 3D integer vector).
# - A *rotation* around the Y-axis (0, 1, 2 or 3).
# - A *flip* vector (a 3D boolean vector).

transform = Transform((1,2,3), 1, (True, False, False))
print(f"1: {transform}")


# The first component is translation. Applying a translation to a vector means simply adding the
# translation to that vector: translating (1,2,3) by (1,1,0) results in (2,3,3).

# Transforms can be applied to vectors using the * operator or the Transform.apply() method.

translation = Transform((1,1,0))

vec = ivec3(1,2,3)

result = translation * vec

print()
print(f"2: {tuple(result)}") # (2, 3, 3)


# The second component is rotation around the Y-axis. Only multiples of 90 degree rotations are
# supported. The options are 0 (no rotation), 1 (90 degree rotation), 2 (180 degree rotation) and 3
# (270 degree rotation). A 90 degree rotation rotates (1,0,0) to (0,0,1). In Minecraft's
# right-handed coordinate system, this is clockwise.

rotate1 = Transform(rotation=1)
rotate2 = Transform(rotation=2)
rotate3 = Transform(rotation=3)

vec = ivec3(1,2,3)

rotated1 = rotate1 * vec
rotated2 = rotate2 * vec
rotated3 = rotate3 * vec

print()
print(f"3: {tuple(rotated1)}") # (-3, 2, 1)
print(f"4: {tuple(rotated2)}") # (-1, 2, -3)
print(f"5: {tuple(rotated3)}") # (3, 2, -1)


# The third component is a flip/mirror vector. Flipping in an axis inverts the sign in that axis.

flipX  = Transform(flip=(True, False, False))
flipXY = Transform(flip=(True, True, False))

vec = ivec3(1,2,3)

flippedX  = flipX  * vec
flippedXY = flipXY * vec

print()
print(f"6: {tuple(flippedX)}")  # (-1, 2, 3)
print(f"7: {tuple(flippedXY)}") # (-1, -2, 3)


# When a Transform object contains multiple components, it flips first, rotates second and
# translates third.

# Transforms can be composed using the @ operator or the Transform.compose() method. There is also
# an @= operator and a corresponding push() method. Note that transformations are not commutative:
# the order in which you compose them matters.

transform1 = Transform(translation=(1,1,1)) @ Transform(rotation=1) # Rotate first, then translate
transform2 = Transform(rotation=1) @ Transform(translation=(1,1,1)) # Translate first, then rotate

print()
print(f"8: {transform1}") # translation=(1, 1, 1), rotation=1, flip=(False, False, False)
print(f"9: {transform2}") # Translation=(-1, 1, 1), rotation=1, flip=(False, False, False)

# The Transform class supports various other math operations. Use help(Transform) for more info.


# ==================================================================================================
# Editor.transform
# ==================================================================================================

# Editor objects have a .transform attribute that represents that editor's "point of view". It is
# applied to all block placement and retrieval positions. You can modify this transform to change
# your local coordinate system.

# A basic usage of Editor.transform is to translate to the build area. Here, we translate only in
# the XZ plane.

editor.transform @= Transform(translation=addY(buildRect.offset))

# Now, when you place a block at (1,100,1), you place it at the *local* (1,100,1) position. If the
# build area started at X=10, Z=20, this would be the global position (11,100,21).

position = (1,100,1)

print(f"\nBuild area XZ offset: {tuple(buildRect.offset)}")
print(f"Placing a block at global position {tuple(editor.transform * position)}")

editor.placeBlock(position, Block("red_concrete"))

# Note that this carries over to all functions that use the editor to get or place blocks,
# including, for example, all geometry functions.

placeBox(editor, Box((1,100,3), (3,3,3)), Block("blue_concrete"))


# The most useful application of Editor.transform is to build a structure defined in local
# coordinates at any position.

# Define a staircase function.

buildStaircase(editor)

# The pattern of pushing a transform, doing something and then popping it off again is very common,
# so there is a context manager to make it easier.

# Editor.pushTransform() creates a context that reverts all changes to the Editor's transform on
# exit.

# If you pass a Transform object as argument, it is pushed to Editor.transform on entry.

# pass a vector to Editor.pushTransform() directly, which will be interpreted as a translation.
with editor.pushTransform((5,100,13)):
    buildStaircase(editor)


# Of course, translating points is fairly easy. You could also just give buildStairs() a position
# parameter and always work with global coordinates. However, things are not so easy when you want
# to rotate or flip a structure. The reason is that, in Minecraft, sometimes *individual blocks*
# need to be rotated or flipped as well. Certain blocks, such as stairs, have an orientation that
# needs to be modified. These orientations are usually stored in block states.
#
# GDPC's transformation system can can automatically deal with most of these orientated blocks.

# Build the staircase at "(9,100,1)", but rotated. Notice how the stairs blocks are rotated as well.
with editor.pushTransform(Transform((9,100,1+2), rotation=3)):

# Build the staircase at "(9,100,5)", but flipped.
with editor.pushTransform(Transform((9,100,5+2), flip=(False, False, True))):
    buildStaircase(editor)


# When using a rotating or flipping transform, note that structures will extend in a different
# direction. For example, a structure extending to positive Z will extend to negative Z when flipped
# in the Z-axis. This is why there are correcting +2's in the translations of the previous
# transforms.
#
# GDPC's `transform` module contains some helper functions that perform these corrections for you.

# Build the staircase at (9,100,9), but rotated.
with editor.pushTransform(rotatedBoxTransform(Box((9,100,9), (3,3,3)), 1)):
    buildStaircase(editor)

# Build the staircase at (9,100,13), but flipped.
with editor.pushTransform(flippedBoxTransform(Box((9,100,13), (3,3,3)), (False, False, True))):
    buildStaircase(editor)


# Build a checkerboard-patterned floor under all structures so you can more easily count blocks.
placeCheckeredBox(

# ==================================================================================================
# Final notes
# ==================================================================================================

# You can also transform an individual Block manually, which may sometimes be useful.

block = Block("oak_stairs", {"facing": "north"})
block = block.transformed(rotation=1)
print(f"\nRotated block 1: {block}") # oak_stairs[facing=east]


# A final thing to keep in mind is that the transformation system can only transform oriented
# blocks if you explicitly specify the orientation. If you simply create stairs block without
# specifying a facing value, Minecraft assigns a default one ("north" in this case) on placement.
# However, the transformation system does not see or modify this default value. This limitation
# might be resolved in a future version of GDPC.

block = Block("oak_stairs") # No facing value specified.
block = block.transformed(rotation=1)
print(f"\nRotated block 2: {block}") # Still no facing value, so the default is still used.
